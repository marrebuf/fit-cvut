bucketsort.cpp was our first homework, which I simply finished as fast as
I could to get the points.  It involved implementing the bucketsort algorithm
given some constraints on the number of certain operations.  Someone else had
already made a satisfying test environment before so I used that, which is also
why there are no rules in the Makefile to compile it.

btreeplus.cpp was the second one.  As you can guess from the filename, it indeed
contains an implementation of a B+tree.  Because I had already implemented
a B-tree (note the minus) in the same year, it wasn't all that complicated for
me, although it still took significant amount of time to complete.

If you run the resulting program, it will generate pictures of the tree just
after inserting and deleting elements.  Or from any other moment you change it
to.  You must have GraphViz installed for it to work, though.

sorttest.cpp is just a toy benchmark I put together.  Again, if you have GnuPlot
with GUI support, it will show you a graph with the results.  I was actually
quite surprised to see that std::sort() can beat qsort() by a factor of two.
Oh, and it's a C++11 program.
