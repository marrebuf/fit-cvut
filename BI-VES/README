Here lies a toy simulator for the graphics part of libves written in GTK+3.
The idea was to make it possible to use the same source file for both simulating
and compiling the main source file for flashing it into the microcontroller.

pic-only/ contains finished assignments that can't be simulated (yet).

ves-serial-control/ is a toy for communicating with the program in serial.c.
I don't really like C# but it was extremely convenient for this task.

The copyright status of many files is questionable, although noone's going to
complain in practice.
