These are source codes I've created in order to pass BI-PA1 at FIT ÄŒVUT in 2011.

For my own needs,  I was using the tcc C interpreter to avoid compiling.  Names
of such source files begin with `tcc-' and they can be executed as they are,
provided that you have tcc installed.  `tcc-cv*.c' are programs written to get
bonus points at practices, `tcc-test*.c' are test exams of previous groups
within the week that practical tests were written.

Homework and my own test exams are regular C++ sources (to clone the progtest
environment I had to compile using g++ -Wall -pedantic).  These can be built
with the provided Makefile.  Just type `make'.

Finally there's the test script I was using to check programs against reference
inputs and outputs that could be downloaded from the progtest website.
