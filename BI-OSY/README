Since I had to strip the numeric ID's from the filenames, and it might not be
evident what this is all about, I'll provide some explanation:

There were two assignments: the first one was about implementing a trivial
"secret service", and intended to exercise us in using threads.  For the
second one, we were able to choose: either implement a simple filesystem,
or aspire for only half of the possible points and rather implement RAID 5
in software.
