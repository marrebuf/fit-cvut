Since I had to strip the numeric ID's from the filenames, and it might not be
evident what this is all about, I'll provide some explanation:

There were two assignments.  The first one was about implementing a trivial
"secret service", and was intended to exercise us in using threads.  For the
second one, we could choose: either implement a simple filesystem, or aspire
for only half of the possible points and rather implement RAID 5 in software.
