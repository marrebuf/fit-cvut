These are source codes I've created in order to pass BI-PA1 at FIT ÄŒVUT in 2011.

For my own needs, I've used the tcc C interpreter to avoid compiling. Names of
such source files begin with 'tcc-' and they can be executed as they are,
provided that you have tcc installed. 'tcc-cv\*.c' are programs written to get
bonus points at practices, 'tcc-test\*.c' are test exams of previous groups
within the week that practical tests were written.

Homeworks and my own test exams are regular C++ sources (to clone the progtest
environment I had to compile using g++ -Wall -pedantic). These can be built
with the provided Makefile. Just type 'make'.

Then there's the test script I've used to check the programs against reference
inputs and outputs that could be downloaded at the progtest website.


You can use these files in good will, though I also welcome money and praise.
