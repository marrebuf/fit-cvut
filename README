This repository is home for the various source codes I had to create at
FIT ÄŒVUT during my studies.  I am probably the first person to publish this
stuff, and I hope this collection is actually going to be helpful to someone.

I've removed as much copyrighted content as possible.  This is the very reason
why you won't be able to find specifications for the assignments.  If you're
longing for them, you'll probably be able to find them at http://fit-wiki.cz

You may use these files in good will, though I also welcome money and praise.


The Makefiles really do work.  If you're using a GNU system, just go into
a directory and type `make' to build all of the contained sources.  You might
need to install some additional programs, though.

Also worth noting, most of the programs have scored the full number of points
that we were able to get for the assignments.
